Pacman as a Java GUI. Very conservative memory usage (uses bytes, not ints).

Pacman.java contains the main method that begins everything.

Running Instructions:

1. cs015.jar should be added to the project library/file path. The .jar contains a 2D array that represents the board and its contents. 

2. Compile all files ( javac *.java )

3. Run the main method of the Pacman.java file ( java Pacman )

I apologize for the poor screenshots. It was a bit difficult to take screenshots while avoiding being eaten by the ghosts.
