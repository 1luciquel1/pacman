###Pacman as a Java GUI.

#####Very conservative memory usage (uses bytes, not ints).

#####Pacman.java contains the main method that begins everything.

###Running Instructions (Commandline for Linux/OSX)

1. Download all files to the same directory

2. Compile the files

    javac -cp "cs015.jar" *.java

3. Run the main method of the Pacman.java file

    java -cp cs015.jar:. Pacman


###Running Instructions (IDE)

1. Download all the files to the same directory/project

2. Add cs015.jar to the project library/file path.

3. Run the main method of the Pacman.java file 


Note: cs015.jar contains a 2D array that represents the board and its contents.
